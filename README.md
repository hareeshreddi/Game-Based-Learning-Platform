# Software Engineering-Game Based Learning Platform:
Description Of The Project:
In this virtual game based learning system, students learn through a gaming environment. The application is a
fully mobile based application. The system provides touch based user interface which will guide student to learn
different sorting algorithms. The student can play and learn during the lecture or outside of the college hours. A
teacher also can use this application as a supplementary for teaching sorting algorithm.
Initial interface will contains menu like play game, restart, quit, user helps etc. Rest part of the screen should
contain the rules for playing the game. Under the play the sorting game player will select any sorting from the
list (The app should contain at least 3 options in the menu for 3 different sorting algorithms). Based on the
selection of the sorting algorithm from the menu, the algorithm in pseudo code should be displayed first. Student
should learn the working principle of the algorithm from there. After pressing the “Start Playing” button, some
3D cubes labeled with some 2-digit numbers in unsorted order will appear on the screen. The cubes on the screen
are swappable. The student should swap the cubes correctly as per his/her understanding of the algorithm. Every
correct swap adds a score of +10 and every wrong swap -10. If a student perform three conjugative incorrect
swaps, a message will be displayed requesting to restart the game. If a player successfully performs all swaps, it
will report the score as per total correct and incorrect swaps and time taken to complete the sorting. The system
also generates game statistic report that include name of the player, max score (without mistake), number of
restarting the game etc.
